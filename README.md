## What This Project Does

Takes the official GameHub APK (114MB) and converts it into a privacy-focused Lite version (51MB):

- **Removes tracking**: 11,838 telemetry/analytics files deleted (Firebase, Google Analytics, Umeng, JPush, etc.)
- **Optimizes size**: PNG images converted to WebP format, unused libraries removed
- **Bypasses authentication**: No login required, works offline
- **Removes permissions**: 31 invasive permissions eliminated (location, mic, camera, contacts, etc.)
- **Redirects network**: All API calls go to self-hostable Cloudflare Workers
- **Adds features**: External launcher support for Daijisho, Launchbox, etc.

**Result:** 114MB bloated APK → 51MB clean APK with zero tracking

---

## Auto-Patcher

The automated patcher applies all modifications to any GameHub APK version.

### Requirements

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install apktool
brew install openjdk@17
brew install --cask android-commandlinetools
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install apktool
sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk
# Install Android SDK command-line tools from https://developer.android.com/studio
```

### Running the Patcher

1. Download the official GameHub APK
2. Place it in this folder
3. Run:
```bash
./autopatcher.sh GameHub-5.1.0.apk
```

The script will:
- Decompile the APK
- Remove 11,838 telemetry files
- Copy 2,851 optimized WebP images
- Apply 201 code patches
- Rebuild and sign the APK

Output: `GameHub-Lite-20251017-003625-signed.apk` (takes 2-3 minutes)

### Install It

```bash
adb install -r GameHub-Lite-*.apk
```

Or drag the APK to your Android device and install normally.

## Required Repositories

This project requires the following Cloudflare Worker repositories for full functionality:

1. **[gamehub-worker](https://github.com/gamehublite/gamehub-worker)** - Main API proxy worker
   - Handles all GameHub API requests
   - Token replacement and signature regeneration
   - Privacy features (IP protection, fingerprint sanitization)

2. **[gamehub_api](https://github.com/gamehublite/gamehub_api)** - Static API resources
   - Component manifests (Wine, Proton, DXVK, VKD3D)
   - Game configurations and profiles
   - Served via GitHub raw URLs

3. **[gamehub-news](https://github.com/gamehublite/gamehub-news)** - News aggregator worker
   - Aggregates gaming news from RSS feeds
   - Tracks GitHub releases for emulation projects
   - Custom HTML styling for mobile

4. **[gamehub-login-token-grabber](https://github.com/gamehublite/gamehub-login-token-grabber)** - Token refresher worker
   - Automated token refresh every 4 hours
   - OTP-based authentication via Mail.tm
   - Stores fresh tokens in KV storage

**Note:** You can self-host all Workers for complete privacy. Right now I'm using free Cloudflare Workers. Don't misuse the project.

## External Launcher Support

Launch Steam games directly from other Android frontends:

```bash
am start -n gamehub.lite/com.xj.landscape.launcher.ui.gamedetail.GameDetailActivity \
  -a gamehub.lite.LAUNCH_GAME \
  --es steamAppId "292030" \
  --ez autoStartGame true
```

This lets you use GameHub as a backend for:
- Daijisho
- Launchbox
- RetroArch
- Any Android launcher that supports custom intents

---

## Troubleshooting

**"apktool not found"**
- Install it: `brew install apktool` (macOS) or `sudo apt-get install apktool` (Linux)

**"Java not found"**
- Install JDK: `brew install openjdk@17` or download from Oracle

**"zipalign not found"**
- Install Android SDK build-tools
- Script will auto-detect if installed via Homebrew

**Some patches failed**
- That's normal. GameHub updates sometimes change code layout
- The script still applies all successful patches (usually 196+ out of 201)
- Failed patches are usually minor and could be manually fixable

**App crashes on launch**
- Something went wrong, check logcat
- Try: `adb uninstall gamehub.lite && adb install -r GameHub-Lite-*.apk`

---

## Customization

### Add Your Own Images
Put PNG/WebP files in `lite_resources/res/drawable-xxhdpi/` and they'll be included in all patched APKs.

Example: We added `wine_game_loading.jpg` (the blue splash screen when games launch).

### Change the Signing Key
Script will auto-generate a new keystore. Default password is `password123`.

### Modify Patches
To add new patches:
1. Make your changes to a decompiled APK
2. Generate diff: `diff -u original.xml modified.xml > patches/mychange.diff`
3. The autopatcher will automatically include it

---

## How the Auto-Patcher Works

The autopatcher does this automatically:

1. **Decompile APK** - Extract all code and resources
2. **Remove bloat** - Delete 11,838 tracking/analytics files
3. **Copy resources** - Add 2,851 optimized WebP images
4. **Apply patches** - Modify 201 code files
5. **Manual fixes** - Fix package name, add missing classes, remove Firebase providers
6. **Rebuild APK** - Recompile everything
7. **Sign APK** - Make it installable

More detailed info on removal: https://github.com/gamehublite/gamehub-oss

The whole process takes 2-3 minutes.

---

## Manual Replication

### Prerequisites
- apktool (decompilation)
- Text editor
- Java JDK 8+
- Android SDK (signing tools)

### Quick Steps
1. Decompile APK with apktool
2. Modify AndroidManifest.xml (remove permissions and components)
3. Modify UserManager.smali (hardcode credentials)
4. Modify EggGameHttpConfig.smali (redirect API)
5. Modify QrLoginHelper.smali and OneKeyAliHelper.smali (neutralize social login)
6. Remove SDK directories (optional)
7. Recompile with apktool
8. Sign with apksigner
9. Install and test

### Detailed Instructions
See `COMPREHENSIVE_SECURITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` Section 8

## Security Implications

### The Good
- Your location isn't being tracked anymore
- No mic/camera surveillance
- They can't fingerprint your device
- No behavioral analytics tracking what you do
- Zero data going to the vendor or Chinese servers

### The Trade-offs
- API calls go through Cloudflare Workers (self-hostable)
- You won't get automatic updates from the vendor
- Some social features might break (login, friends, etc.)

**Bottom line:** Self-host all Workers for complete privacy. This is for personal privacy research. Don't distribute the modded APK.
